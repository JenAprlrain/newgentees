          <div className="font-bold">Why not print on demand?</div> Drop
          shipping and print on demand solutions often offer less customization
          options and lower quality consistent with todayâ€™s fast fashion and
          mass production. We are completely counter-culture to this movement,
          and take it a step further. By securing apparel to the blockchain
          through 1-of-1 pairing, we add a layer of security, sustainability,
          proof-of-ownership and authenticity consistent with our desire to
          provide maximum value to our partners and their communities.
